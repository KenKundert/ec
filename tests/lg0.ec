# Constans for Loop Gain Calculations

88.3u "V/per" =Kdet   # gain of phase detector
9.07G "Hz/V" =Kvco    # gain of voltage controlled oscillator
2 =M                  # divide ratio of divider at output of VCO
8 =N                  # divide ratio of main divider
2 =F                  # divide ratio of prescaler

Introducing ec
==============
This is ec, a version of ec that is provided for use with newer versions of
python. This version of ec requires python 2.6 or later and the docutils
package. Another version of ec called ec0 is available that has been tested to
work on python 2.3 or later and does not require docutils.  If you have a
choice, it is recommended that you used the normal version of ec.  That version
more likely to be updated and enhanced. If you don't have a recent version of
python, you can install it from source (not as difficult as it sounds,
directions are given below).  However, if that is not your thing; ec0 is the
version for you (once installed, it masquerades as ec).

ec is available from https://github.com/KenKundert/ec.
ec0 is available from https://github.com/KenKundert/ec0.

To download ec, use either:
    $ git clone git://github.com/KenKundert/ec.git
Using git allows you to get updates using:
    $ git pull
Alternatively, you can download the source as a tar or zip file by visiting
https://github.com/KenKundert/ec0/downloads or by running:
    $ wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/KenKundert/ec/tarball/master
    $ tar zxf master
    $ rm -rf master ec
    $ mv KenKundert-ec-* ec

Once you have your copy of ec, test it with
    $ ./test
All tests should pass. Then you can install it using
    $ ./install
It will install the program into ~/.local.  Both the program and a man page are 
installed. You do not need root access to install into ~/.local, but in doing so 
it is only easily accessible by you and you will need to add ~/.local/bin
to your PATH. Alternatively, you can edit ./install and remove the '--user' 
option.  That will cause EC to be installed so that it is accessible to all 
users without having to change their PATH, but it requires that you be root when 
you run the ./install command.

Installing Python from Source
=============================
If you do not have a recent version of Python installed on your machine, you can
install a copy even if you do not have root access.

These instructions assume that the source will be placed in ~/packages and the 
binaries will be placed in ~/.local. You will need to adapt the instructions 
accordingly if you want to place the files in different places. You should also 
adapt the instructions so as the get the latest available versions for python 
and setuptools.

Getting python ...
    $ mkdir ~/packages
    $ cd ~/packages
    $ mkdir python
    $ cd python
    $ wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/Python-2.7.3.tgz

Making python ...
    $ tar zxf Python-2.7.3.tgz
    $ cd Python-2.7.3
    $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
    $ make
    $ make install
    $ cd ..

To use this version of python, you should put ~/.local/bin on your path. It must 
be early on your path so that by default you get this version of python (run 
'which python' to confirm).

Then you should install setuptools
    $ wget "http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11.tar.gz"
    $ tar zxf setuptools-0.6c11.tar.gz
    $ cd setuptools-0.6c11
    $ python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/.local
    $ cd ..

From here you can easily install many of the your favorite modules.
Specifically, you should install docutils.
    $ easy_install docutils
